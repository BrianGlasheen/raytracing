# C++ Raytracer / Software Rasterizer
![Alt Text](https://github.com/BrianGlasheen/raytracing/blob/main/resources/output_13.gif?raw=true)

this code is really gross, i want to go back to refactor and expand on this at some point

for best results use a res of >= 256 pixels, 
its multithreaded so they dont take too long

to run
./A6 [taskNum] [image size] [output filename]
output filename doesn't need '.png', it's added

scenes 1-8 are the assigned scenes

scene 9 is blending blinn phong with reflections
scene 10 is scene 9 with rough reflections
scene 11 is refractions
scene 12 is refractions with rough reflections and blinn phong/reflection blending
scene 13 is for animation
